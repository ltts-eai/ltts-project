#RESNET 50 
 DATASET USED **IMAGENET**
Let us discuss the demonstration on how the techniques allowed us to achieve 81.9% Top 1 Accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet50, outperforming pre-existing SOTA results. 

Choosing the best neural network training recipe for deep learning models is challenging. A paper called “Resnet Strikes Back” demonstrated the significance of the right training for training ResNet50 on ImageNet. They boosted ResNet50 to a top-1 accuracy of 80.4% on ImageNet-1K. The original ResNet50 recipe reached 75.8% accuracy, so this improved.
