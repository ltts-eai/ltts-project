# Knowledge Distillation

Knowledge Distillation is a technique used in machine learning to transfer the knowledge from a large, complex model to a smaller, simpler model. It involves training the smaller model to mimic the output of the larger model, by learning from the soft targets (probabilistic predictions) generated by the larger model, rather than the hard targets (actual labels) in the training data.

The main idea behind knowledge distillation is that a large, complex model has learned to capture the underlying patterns and structure in the data, which can be transferred to a smaller, simpler model through the soft targets generated by the larger model. By training the smaller model to mimic the output of the larger model, the smaller model can achieve comparable performance to the larger model, while using fewer resources and being more computationally efficient.

Knowledge Distillation is typically performed after a large, complex model has been trained and can be used to create a smaller model that is optimized for deployment in scenarios with limited computational resources, such as mobile devices or IoT devices. In addition to reducing the size and complexity of a model, knowledge distillation can also help to reduce overfitting, as the smaller model is trained to learn from the soft targets generated by the larger model, which can be more robust to noisy or incomplete data.

Overall, knowledge distillation is a powerful technique for transferring knowledge from a large, complex model to a smaller, simpler model, while maintaining the performance and accuracy of the original model.
