#TENSORFLOW

In this session, we will examine several optimisation techniques, such as weight pruning, by training a tf.keras model from scratch for the MNIST dataset. This model will serve as the baseline for conversion to a tflite model.

The major goal of this notebook is to comprehend tflite and other model optimisations, hence the modelling portion will be kept straightforward.
