ONNX, or Open Neural Network Exchange, is an **open-source** standard for representing deep learning models. It was developed by Facebook and Microsoft in order to make it easier for researchers and engineers to move models between different deep-learning frameworks and hardware platforms.

it allows models to be easily exported from one framework, such as PyTorch, and imported into another framework, such as TensorFlow. This can be especially useful for researchers who want to try out different frameworks for training and deploying their models

ONNX also provides a set of tools for optimizing and quantizing models, which can help to reduce the memory and computational requirements of the model. This can be especially useful for deploying models on edge devices and other resource-constrained environments.
Another important feature of ONNX is that it is supported by a wide range of companies and organizations. This includes not only Facebook and Microsoft, but also companies like Amazon, NVIDIA, and Intel. This wide range of support ensures that ONNX will continue to be actively developed and maintained, making it a robust and stable standard for representing deep learning models.
