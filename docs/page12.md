ONNX, or Open Neural Network Exchange, is an **open-source** standard for representing deep learning models. It was developed by Facebook and Microsoft in order to make it easier for researchers and engineers to move models between different deep-learning frameworks and hardware platforms.

it allows models to be easily exported from one framework, such as PyTorch, and imported into another framework, such as TensorFlow. This can be especially useful for researchers who want to try out different frameworks for training and deploying their models

ONNX also provides a set of tools for optimizing and quantizing models, which can help to reduce the memory and computational requirements of the model. This can be especially useful for deploying models on edge devices and other resource-constrained environments.
Another important feature of ONNX is that it is supported by a wide range of companies and organizations. This includes not only Facebook and Microsoft, but also companies like Amazon, NVIDIA, and Intel. This wide range of support ensures that ONNX will continue to be actively developed and maintained, making it a robust and stable standard for representing deep learning models.
-ONNX Runtime is an open-source inference engine for executing ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) models. It is designed to be high-performance and lightweight, making it well-suited for deployment on a wide range of hardware platforms, including edge devices, servers, and cloud services.
-The ONNX Runtime provides a C++ API, a C# API, and a Python API for executing ONNX models. It also provides support for multiple backends, including CUDA and OpenCL, which allows it to run on a wide range of hardware platforms, such as NVIDIA GPUs and Intel CPUs.
-ONNX Runtime can be very useful since you can use models in inference with a single framework no matter what hardware you are going to use. So without having to actually rewrite the code depending on whether we want to use a CPU, GPU, FPGA or whatever.
-ONNX Runtime also provides support for a wide range of models, including both traditional machine learning models and deep learning models. 
-One of the main advantages of ONNX Runtime is its performance. It uses various techniques such as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, kernel fusion and subgraph partitioning to optimize the performance of the model. It also supports thread pooling and inter-node communication for distributed deployment which makes it a suitable choice for large-scale deployment. -One of the main advantages of ONNX Runtime is its performance.

FOR EXAMPLE:
Let us look at an example scenario where your goal is to deploy your trained model via an iOS app. You are comfortable putting together neural network models in Keras, an easy-to-use interface for the TensorFlow framework. Your journey starts by understanding the hardware through which your app gets used by the user. Modern Apple devices come with Apple Neural Engine (ANE) as part of the chip. 
The A15 Bionic chip on iPhone 14 comes with 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine (ANE). On this device, your deep learning model can work on CPU only, CPU and GPU, or all computing engines (CPU, GPU, and ANE). ANE is the fastest way to run your model, especially for heavy applications. On iOS, CoreML is the framework that is optimized for deep learning inference. Also, CoreML is built into the operating system which means there is no need for you to compile, link, or ship your ML binary libraries with the app.
Now that your target framework is defined, you need to find a way to convert your trained model into Core ML. This task can be easily achieved via ONNX - convert your Keras model to ONNX using the tf2onnx library and convert ONNX to Core ML model using the onnx-coreml library in python.  The Core ML model is now ready to be deployed into your app.
