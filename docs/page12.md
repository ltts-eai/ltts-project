ONNX, or Open Neural Network Exchange, is an **open-source** standard for representing deep learning models. It was developed by Facebook and Microsoft in order to make it easier for researchers and engineers to move models between different deep-learning frameworks and hardware platforms.

it allows models to be easily exported from one framework, such as PyTorch, and imported into another framework, such as TensorFlow. This can be especially useful for researchers who want to try out different frameworks for training and deploying their models
